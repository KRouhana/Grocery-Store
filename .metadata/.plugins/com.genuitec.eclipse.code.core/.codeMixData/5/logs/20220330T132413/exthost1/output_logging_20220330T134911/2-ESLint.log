To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder GroceryStore-Frontend
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn or pnpm instead of npm set the setting `eslint.packageManager` to either `yarn` or `pnpm`
Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder GroceryStore-Frontend by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
